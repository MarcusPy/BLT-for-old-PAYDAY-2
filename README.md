# BLT-for-old-PAYDAY-2
First release of BLT, edited to run in PD2s as old as pre-betas and until better ones are available officially (2015-ish?)

Tested on beta 0.0.9, Release - U49

Known issues:
  - Mod settings and their saves don't work, you have edit those manually in your mod's code
  - Update widget is unresponsive, doesn't affect anything really since you'll be running outdated mods anyway
